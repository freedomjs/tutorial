# What is freedom.js, and why should I care?

# What are some apps that have been built using freedom.js?

# Tutorial outline
The tutorial steps through the development of Dorabella, mentioned
above. If you're a new developer then soldiering on in order is
probably a good idea, but if you're already comfortable with the
JavaScript ecosystem then picking and choosing or skipping through may
make sense. The topics of the remaining sections are:

- [Dev Environment Setup](../02devsetup) - the basic commands you need to install
  freedom.js and related development tools
- [How freedom.js works](../03howfreedomworks) - an explanation of the control and messaging
  flow of a freedom.js-powered application
- [Designing Dorabella](../04dorabelladesign) - how to plan the structure and API of an app
- [The core of Dorabella](../05dorabellacore) - once it's planned, how to get started
  implementing the boilerplate and beyond
- [Implementing chat](../06dorabellachat) - the main task of Dorabella, and a tour of the
  freedom.js social interface
- [Using crypto in freedom.js](../07dorabellacrypto) - an important but sensitive part of
  development, also provided by freedom.js
- [Polishing Dorabella](../08dorabellapolish) - testing, automation, and those other tweaks
  that make an app ready to go
- [Deployment and Beyond](../09deploymentandbeyond) - now that the app is written, it's time to
  get it out there
- [How to help freedom.js](../10howtohelpfreedom) - we're an open source project and welcome
  contributions!
