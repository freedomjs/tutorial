In this section we will add an actual social API provider so we can finish the
implementation of several of the main module methods. At the end we will have a
functional chat application, though not yet with encryption.

# Depending on other freedom.js modules
Our application is growing larger - we now need to think not just about the
"outer" page communicating with the main freedom.js module, but also the main
freedom.js module loading and communicating with other freedom.js modules. At
first this may seem like a lot of work, but there are significant advantages to
a modular approach. Over time we hope to see an ecosystem of freedom.js modules
that enable developers to get a quick start in developing a variety of
decentralized applications.

TODO

# Back to the UI
Now that we have a fully functional chat application, we should revisit the UI
and make sure it provides all the necessary information and interaction.
