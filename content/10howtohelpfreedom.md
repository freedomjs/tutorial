# Make an app!
The single best thing you can do for *freedom.js* is to use the
knowledge you've gained from this tutorial and go out and make
something - any app, large or small, that is built to enable
decentralization makes the entire decentralized ecosystem stronger. So
go out and create, whether it's a game or a tool, a quick hack or a
longterm project, and share your creation with the world.

# Give us feedback
As you're making an app you may think of things you wish were
different about *freedom.js* - maybe a new feature it could support,
or a bug that should be
fixed. [GitHub issues](https://github.com/freedomjs/freedom/issues)
are our preferred workflow for this sort of feedback, and we also have
a
[freedomjs-users Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/freedomjs-users)
for updates and discussion.

# Develop *freedom.js* providers
*freedom.js* includes providers for all its interfaces, but you can also
create new providers that satisfy the same interfaces, expanding the
realm of *freedom.js* functionality. For instance, a new social provider
compatible with the latest hip social network would allow *freedom.js*
apps (old and new) to seamlessly adopt it as an alternative to the
existing social network providers.

# Contribute to *freedom.js*
*freedom.js* is developed in the open across our
[GitHub repos](https://github.com/freedomjs), and we welcome
[pull requests](https://github.com/freedomjs/freedom/pulls) with
contributions. Note that contributions to the core of *freedom.js* are
different from writing your own providers - they should be something
that is useful to all *freedom.js* users (such as a bugfix or new
compatibility shim).

Thanks for reading, and Hack On!
